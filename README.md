# wenruji.fun Contracts

Welcome to **wenruji.fun Contracts**, a collection of experimental, open-source arcade game contracts built on **game-theory principles** and inspired by **Rujira-Merge contract dynamics**. This repository provides the foundation for community-driven games that focus on strategic decision-making and are designed to foster enjoyment and interaction within the wenruji.fun community.

## Purpose

The contracts in this repository are intended to support arcade games hosted on [wenruji.fun](https://wenruji.fun) and other partner sites, creating an engaging space for the community to enjoy during the Rujira migration period. While there is no immediate plan to migrate these games, a future migration could be considered based on community engagement and demand.

## Key Principles

- **Game-Theory Driven**: Each game leverages principles from game theory to provide players with complex, strategic, and immersive experiences.
- **Inspired by Rujira-Merge Dynamics**: Gameplay is built upon unique contract-based mechanisms inspired by the Rujira-Merge contract, providing a distinctive and enjoyable experience.
- **Community-Centric**: This project is dedicated to fostering a fun and inclusive community. Contributions, modifications, and improvements are encouraged, provided they align with the community's best interests.

## Disclaimer

All contracts in this repository have been thoroughly tested but have **not been audited**. Please use them at your own discretion and risk.
